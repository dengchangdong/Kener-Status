## Triggers

Triggers are used to trigger actions based on the status of your monitors. You can use triggers to send notifications, or call webhooks when a monitor goes down or up.

## Webhook

Webhook triggers are used to send a HTTP POST request to a URL when a monitor goes down or up.

<div class="border rounded-md">

![Trigger API](/documentation/trig_web.png)

</div>

### URL

<span class="text-red-500 text-xs font-semibold">
	REQUIRED
</span>

The URL is used to define the URL of the webhook. It is required and has to be a valid URL.

You can also pass secrets that are set in the environment variables.

Example: `https://example.com/webhook?secret=$SECRET_X`. Make sure `$SECRET_X` is set in the environment variables.

### Method

Method will always be `POST`

### Headers

The headers are used to define the headers that should be sent with the request. It is optional and has to be a valid JSON object. You can add secrets that are set in the environment variables.

Example: `Authorization: Bearer $SECRET_Y`. Make sure `$SECRET_Y` is set in the environment variables.

While sending webhook kener will add two more headers: `Content-Type: application/json` and `User-Agent: Kener/3.0.0`.

### Body

Body of the webhook will be sent as below:

```json
{
    "id": "mockoon-9",
    "alert_name": "Mockoon DOWN",
    "severity": "critical",
    "status": "TRIGGERED",
    "source": "Kener",
    "timestamp": "2024-11-27T04:55:00.369Z",
    "description": "üö® **Service Alert**: Check the details below",
    "details": {
        "metric": "Mockoon",
        "current_value": 1,
        "threshold": 1
    },
    "actions": [
        {
            "text": "View Monitor",
            "url": "https://kener.ing/monitor-mockoon"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Custom Body

Using [mustache variables](#triggers-trigger-variables) you can customize the body of the webhook. If you are not using a json body then please make sure you are using the right content-type by setting custom headers.

### Examples

#### 1. Telegram

You can use the webhook trigger to send a message to a telegram channel. Enable `Use a custom webhook body`.

Set the URL to `https://api.telegram.org/bot[BOT_TOKEN]/sendMessage`. Replace [BOT_TOKEN] with your bot token.

```json
{
    "chat_id": "[CHAT_ID]", // Replace [CHAT_ID] with your chat id
    "text": "<b>{{alert_name}}</b>\n\n<b>Severity:</b> <code>{{severity}}</code>\n<b>Status:</b> {{status}}\n<b>Source:</b> Kener\n<b>Time:</b> {{timestamp}}\n\nüìå <b>Details:</b>\n- <b>Metric:</b>{{metric}}\n- <b>Current Value:</b> <code>{{current_value}}</code>\n- <b>Threshold:</b> <code>{{threshold}}</code>\n\nüîç <a href=\"{{action_url}}\">{{action_text}}</a>",
    "parse_mode": "HTML"
}
```

If you want to send a message to a group, then replace `[CHAT_ID]` with the group id.

You can also use environment variables to store the bot token and chat id. In that case the URL will be `https://api.telegram.org/bot$BOT_TOKEN/sendMessage`. In the body you can use `"chat_id": "$CHAT_ID"`. Make sure you have set the `BOT_TOKEN` and `CHAT_ID` in the <a href="/docs/environment-vars#secrets">environment variables</a>.

#### 2. Conditional Webhook

You can use `is_triggered` and `is_resolved` to create conditional webhooks.

```json
{
    "title": "Monitor Alert for {{metric}} has been {{#is_triggered}}üî¥ Triggered{{/is_triggered}}{{#is_resolved}}üü¢ Resolved{{/is_resolved}}. Current value is {{current_value}} and threshold set is {{threshold}}"
}
```

The output will be

```json
{
    "title": "Monitor Alert for Mockoon has been üî¥ Triggered. Current value is 1 and threshold set is 1"
}
```

```json
{
    "title": "Monitor Alert for Mockoon has been üü¢ Resolved. Current value is 0 and threshold set is 1"
}
```

#### 3. Combing mustache with env variables

Combine the above example with `NODE_ENV` environment variable.

```json
{
    "title": "Monitor Alert for {{metric}} in environment $NODE_ENV has been {{#is_triggered}}üî¥ Triggered{{/is_triggered}}{{#is_resolved}}üü¢ Resolved{{/is_resolved}}. Current value is {{current_value}} and threshold set is {{threshold}}."
}
```
